# Ciphers

A collection of ciphers of the substitution type that will be modelled mathematically were applicable and implemented using Python. Towards the end of this project, the ciphers will be consolidated into a main script that will run using user input.

Currently, the list of ciphers to include (subject to change) are:

  * Monoalphabetic
  * Caesar 
  * One-Time Pad
  * Playfair
  * Vigenere
  * Hill
