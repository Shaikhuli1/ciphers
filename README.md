# Ciphers

A collection of ciphers of the substitution type that will be modelled mathematically were applicable and implemented using Python. Towards the end of this project, the ciphers will be consolidated into a main script that will run using user input.

Currently, the list of ciphers to include and how they work (subject to change) are below:

  * [Simple substitution](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/simple-substitution-cipher/)
  * [Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) 
  * One-Time Pad
  * Playfair
  * [Vigenere](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vigenere-cipher/)
  * Hill
  * Four-Square

Both encryption and decryption methods should be with each cipher
